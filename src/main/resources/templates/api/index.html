        summary: &quot;The first thing visible in Java 8 is the lambdas, but the real power is in Streams.
        If you're interested in immersing into lambdas and streams, this is the session for you.
        We will start with lambda expressions, learn about how to use them and how they get implemented under the hood. Then we will swiftly move into learning about streams, the abstractions they provide, and a variety of operations we can do with them. We will conclude with a discussion  about lazy evaluations, infinite streams, and parallel collections.&quot;,

But the landscape is much broader and, today, developers must write code that will run on a multitude of different systems that do not offer the same flexibility as classic &quot;computers&quot;. In this talk, I'll explain why security is important and why we (infosec people and developers) need to work together. Then I'll review some challenges that developers could face when developing on small hardware platforms and how to decrease the risks associated to them.&quot;,

                summary: &quot;After numerous presentation on the JSR107, this in-depth 3 hour university session will twist the problem upside down. Instead of leading you through every aspect of the new Caching API for Java, we'll start from a real Java application, looking at its architecture, measure contention points and slowly start adding different caching patterns to it.
                We'll look beyond the specification as well, not in terms of proprietary APIs, but in terms of different cache topologies (onheap, offheap, distributed, ...) and considerations around them when introducing caching to both an existing or architecting a new one.
                Finally, we shall look at how different application containers and framework may affect decisions we've made during the session. &quot;,
